<p align="left">
  We developed a taxi-sharing system that accepts taxi passengers.Passenger requests sent from
smartphones and schedules proper taxis to pick up them via ridesharing, subject to time, capacity, and monetary constraints.
Indeed, such apps make short-range commute very easy by offering competitive pricing, reasonably short wait time, high security and high availability. 
From a technical point of view, systems like these are very interesting because nearest-neighbor searching is hard. 
These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.
