<h3>Project description</h3>

<p align="left">
 Ride-sharing is an innovative on-demand transport service that aims to promote sustainable transport, reduce car utilization, increase vehicle occupancy, and increase public transport ridership. When it comes to getting about in cities, many people choose ride-sharing apps like Uber or Lyft. Indeed, such apps make short-range commute very easy by offering competitive pricing, reasonably short wait time, high security and high availability. From a technical point of view, systems like these are very interesting because nearest-neighbor searching is hard.  We developed a taxi-sharing system that accepts taxi passengers. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world. A user can request a ride through the application and within a few minutes, a driver arrives nearby his/her location to take them to their destination. It has a backend service, a frontend service, and a single database. Passenger requests are sent from smartphones, and ridesharing apps schedule proper taxis to pick them up, subject to time, capacity, and monetary constraints.
