<p align="left">
 Ride-sharing is an innovative on-demand transport service that aims to promote sustainable transport, reduce car utilization, increase vehicle occupancy, and increase public transport ridership. We developed a taxi-sharing system that accepts taxi passengers. Passenger requests are sent from smartphones,Â and ridesharing apps schedule proper taxis to pick them up, subject to time, capacity, and monetary constraints. Indeed, such apps make short-range commutes very easy by offering competitive pricing, a reasonably short wait time, high security, and high availability. From a technical point of view, systems like these are very interesting because nearest-neighbor searching is hard. These systems have a much more complex architecture, and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide transportation services all over the world.
